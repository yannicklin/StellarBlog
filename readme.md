## Stellar Blog using Laravel PHP Framework 5.1

This is a challenge from Stellar Technology for demonstration the power of Laravel PHP Framework 5.1
We used the Laravel Framework 5.1 + Sqlite3 as the backend server handling.
The majority of frontend work is based on the Twitter Bootstrap 3.3 and also the addon such as [Bootstrap Switch] (https://github.com/nostalgiaz/bootstrap-switch).

### Following Improvements

Not fully setup the debug for Laravel. Only put the [barryvdh/laravel-debugbar](https://github.com/barryvdh/laravel-debugbar) & [barryvdh/laravel-ide-helper](https://github.com/barryvdh/laravel-ide-helper) .
